/*Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #*/
let s = "";
let l = " ";

for(let i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
  let numeral = String(i);
  numeral = "#";
  s += numeral + " ";
}
//this cycle is responsible of doing the 8 lines.
