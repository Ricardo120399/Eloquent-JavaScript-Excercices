In this repository I am going to upload all EloquenteJavaScript exircices completed as a way to help those in need with the exercices, however, this is not intended to be a way to just copy-paste without any mental effort, as you may know the art of programming can just be learned by do it so I highly recommend you to first tried to do the exercices by yourself and then came here in order to compare my solution with yours... at the end of the day there is no a unique way to solve the challenge so my code might be different from yours, the important thing here is not the code itself but the way that you solve the challenge throughout your coding skills, so have a nice coding a feel free to use this repo as a reference if you need it to.
